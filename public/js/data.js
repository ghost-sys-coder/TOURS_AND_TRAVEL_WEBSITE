        testimonial: "Did this tour on 220901. A very nice experience! Its so cool to be at the source of the Nile, the very point where lake Victoria meets the Nile. Lots of beautiful bird life can be observed, if you are lucky even the king fisher! And the waterfall at Ssezibwa has some amazing scenery. If you want twins this is the place you want to go to make offers to the gods for it. I've done three tours with Kampala City Trekkers during my stay in Kampala and I'm very satisfied with everyone of them. Thank you!",
